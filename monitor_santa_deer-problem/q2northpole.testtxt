  TEST 3:
  -------
    DATA DESCRIPTION
    Test with 1 as the bound on the number of times the reindeer get served ahead of the elves,
    1 and 2 as the number of elves, 1003 as the seed, 1 as the number of consultations, 1 as the number of deliveries.
    
    This test is to see whether the elves will fail consultation immediately after acquiring help. (without being
    blocked since there is only 1 elfe, it cannot form a group of consultation for sure)

    TESTING
    Here is the script-fixed log of the testing performed with line numbers attached.
    (Script is cut to save space)

    number of elves: 1

    ANALYSIS
    Line 3 shows that no error is produced.

    From this we can say that each condition in the program has been exercised, and the synchronization has been shown to be correct.
