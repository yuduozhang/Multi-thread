It's a deadlock.

Generously, definition of a deadlock is "the state when one or more
processes are waiting for an event that will not occur."

At the climax, there are four Angels, say they are A1,A2,A3,A4. But A1,
and A2 are looking at each other, and A3 and A4 are also looking at each other. 
So there is a deadlock, since A1 is waiting for A2 to move his sight, but A2 
is being looked at by A1 at the same time, so A2 cannot move unless A1
moves firstly. But A1 also cannot move until A2 moves. Hence they are
waiting for each other to move firstly, which is an event that cannot
happen. Similar situations happen for A3 and A4.

Hence it's a deadlock.
